## INTRODUCTION

Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are critical components in building infrastructure,
responsible for maintaining indoor environmental quality by regulating temperature, humidity, and air quality.
These systems are essential for ensuring occupant comfort and energy efficiency, which are increasingly
important in the context of global energy consumption and environmental impact. HVAC systems are
designed to ensure thermal comfort for building occupants by controlling indoor climate conditions [1] They
account for a significant portion of global energy consumption and carbon emissions, making their
optimization crucial for energy efficiency and environmental sustainability[2]. HVAC systems typically
include components such as air conditioners, heaters, ventilation ducts, and thermostats, which work
together to maintain desired indoor conditions. The systems are often controlled using various algorithms
and models to optimize performance and reduce energy consumption[3].

Reinforcement Learning (RL), including Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and their variants, has been
applied to optimize HVAC control by framing it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). These methods aim to
improve system performance by learning optimal control policies that balance energy efficiency with
occupant comfort. Managing the large state space and ensuring tractability in RL applications is a significant
challenge, necessitating the development of efficient algorithms and models [3], [4]. Techniques such as
variable-length rolling horizon optimization and stochastic optimization are used to handle uncertainties in
building energy management, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of HVAC systems. The integration of
energy storage systems with HVAC control can further reduce operating costs and improve energy
management during peak electricity price periods[1]

## DEEP Q-NETWORK (DQN)

Deep Q-Network (DQN) is an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm that extends Q-learning, a
fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm. It was developed by DeepMind in 2015 and has since been
applied in various control problems, including HVAC systems. Unlike traditional Q-learning, which uses
tables to store Q-values, DQN employs deep neural networks (DNNs) to approximate the Q-value function,
enabling it to handle high-dimensional and continuous state spaces where tabular Q-learning would be
impractical [3], [5], [6], [7]. To enhance the stability of the learning process, DQN incorporates two key
techniques:

**Separate Target Q-network** : It uses a separate target Q-network alongside the primary Q-network. The
parameters of the Q-network are periodically copied to the target network to stabilize the learning
process[5], [7]

**Experience Replay Buffer** : DQN utilizes an experience replay buffer to store past experiences. During
training, samples are randomly drawn from this buffer, which helps mitigate issues related to correlated data
and improves convergence[5], [7]

## DUELING DEEP Q-NETWORK (D3QN)


D3QN, or Double Dueling Deep Q-Network, is an enhanced version of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm,
primarily used in reinforcement learning. It improves upon DQN by addressing issues of overestimation
during Q-value learning and enhancing stability and convergence speed. D3QN combines the principles of
Double DQN and Dueling DQN, which include using two identical Q-networks and introducing a value
function and an advantage function to accelerate convergence speed. This combination enhances the
algorithm's performance, stability, and reliability, particularly in complex environments. D3QN demonstrates
superior optimization performance, stability, and reliability compared to DQN, especially in HVAC system
control projects. It shows a more robust efficacy in improving the system's coefficient of performance (COP)
over time, indicating better control capability and adaptability. While DQN is effective, D3QN's additional
mechanisms provide a significant advantage in handling diverse and complex control tasks[2]. In energy-
saving applications, D3QN can achieve better results from the early stages of deployment compared to DQN,
which may require more exploration time before converging on an optimal policy[7]

## PREVIOUS WORKS

The complex problem of balancing tenants thermal comfort while minimizing energy consumption has been
a hot topic of research in recent years.Tsenis et al.s SmartKlima used DQN and double DQN to optimize the
heating conditions of a residential building and their model was able to achieve strong convergence under
certain conditions [8]. Ghane et al presented a model-free, offline reinforcement learning approach for
optimizing thermostat control in HVAC systems. Their Dueling double DQN (D3QN) network , trained using
historical data from HomeLab 1, was able to achieve an 18.66% reduction in energy use compared to
traditional rule based methods [5]. Liu et al developed a novel reinforcement learning algorithm
that combines DQN and XGBoost for HVAC and window control optimization. Their model improved indoor
thermal comfort duration by 24% and reduced air conditioning runtime by 24.7% compared to baseline
models [6]. McKee et al. employed a model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning to minimize energy costs in
HVAC operations. They utilized DQN for reinforcement learning control objectives and explored Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for continuous action spaces. Their DRL controller achieved a 43.89%
cost reduction compared to traditional methods in a simulated environment [9]. Han et al. used a deep forest
based deep Q-network (DF-DQN) to optimize cooling water systems. Their DF-DQN model avoided
unnessary explorations and converged faster and has a better energy-saving effect in the early stages
compared to DQN [7]. Barrett et al. applied tabular Q-Learning and Bayesian inference to optimize a
thermostat and were able to achieve a 10% cost reduction compared to the programmable control method
[4]. Yu et al. proposed a knowledge-based reinforcement learning control approach for cooling towers in
HVAC systems. Their DQN model utilizes a knowledge based exploration strategy, reducing training time and
improving control performance. Their model demonstrates lower Integral Absolute Error (IAE) and Integral
Square Error (ISE) than the Proportional Integral (PI) controller [10]. Wang et al. proposed a DQN-based
building energy management (BEM) method to reduce operating costs while ensuring occupant comfort.
Their method integrates a third-order thermal model to accurately simulate dynamic temperature changes in
buildings. Simulation results confirm the method's effectiveness in enhancing energy flexibility and reducing
costs during peak electricity price periods [1]. In another research, Wang et al. explored classical and deep
reinforcement learning methods for HVAC control. They highlighted the importance of state space choices in
high-dimensional observation environments and identified DQN as a suitable method for HVAC control tasks
due to its balanced performance [3]. Finally, Qin et al. did a comparative study of DQN and dueling double
DQN (D3QN) for HVAC system optimization. Their study highlights D3QN's superior optimization
effectiveness and stability across various HVAC projects compared to DQN. Their proposed D3QN structure
includes two hidden layers with 64 and 12 neurons, respectively[2].


## CURRENT WORK

In this study, three deep reinforcement learning models were evaluated for autonomous HVAC control: a
vanilla DQN model, a custom Dueling Q-Network (DuelingQNet) and a Dueling Double DQN model inspired
by prior research (D3QNP). Both models were trained for 10,000 episodes using the same environment and
reward shaping. All the source code, as well as trained models can be found in the github link below:

## ENVIRONMENT

The main source and inspiration for the environment design was the paper by E. Barrett and S. Linder, titled
‚ÄúAutonomous HVAC Control, A Reinforcement Learning Approach‚Äù [4]. Based on the fixed values and
formulas in this paper, an office environment was designed. While the office is located in Istanbul, it was
modeled using weather data from the year 199 1. The dimensions of the office are 3√ó3 meters. According to
one-year weather data for Istanbul obtained from the Energy Plus [11] website, the temperature ranges
between -8¬∫C and 31¬∫C. The working hours of the office are defined as every week day between 8:00 and
18:00. Holidays were calculated based on pythons holiday library. The presence or absence of people in the
office is detected by a sensor that checks and returns the status every minute. The air conditioner in the
room is capable of both heating and cooling. The environment was coded to comply with the Gym format,
and a separate class was defined to perform Bayesian inference.

## STATE AND ACTƒ∞ONS

The air conditioner, which acts as the agent, receives 3 types of data from the environment:

- the office temperature (room temperature / rt),
- the outside temperature (outside temperature / ot),
- and the estimated time until people arrive (time to occupancy / tto).

After receiving this data, it can perform 3 actions:

- Turn on heating (Heat On),
- Turn on cooling (Heat Off),
- Turn off the HVAC (Therm Off).

During the learning process, the air conditioner performs one of these three actions every minute.

Three different DQN architechtures were used in this research, a normal (vanilla) DQN, and two D3QN
models (A custom D3QN and D3QNP). D3QNP is a simpler version of D3QN that matches the architecture in
[2]. The details of each model are given in the table below

## TRAINING LOOP

Training typically took around 8-10 hours. Different techniques were utilize to optimize the training including
shuffling the days at the beginning of each year to reduce overfitting and decreasing the batch size to speed
up training, and clipping the rewards to stabilize learning. The training parameters are listed in the table

## RESULTS

The results of the 3 models are listed in the table below. The results confirm the superiority of D3QN over
DQN when it comes to optimizing HVAC projects and affirm the architechture proposed by Qin et al. in [2] as
it was the best-performing-model. The results show that the D3QNP model outperforms DuelingQNet in
terms of learning speed, stability, and overall performance. Specifically, D3QNP achieved higher and more
consistent total rewards per episode, with a sharper and more concentrated reward distribution around
optimal values. In contrast, DuelingQNet exhibited slower convergence, broader reward distribution, and
greater variance in early training episodes. This suggests that the architectural and training optimizations
adopted from the reference paper‚Äîsuch as smaller, more efficient networks and better value-advantage
separation‚Äîenhanced learning efficiency. Overall, the findings support adopting the D3QNP structure for
more effective HVAC policy learning in future work.

## CONCLUSION

The comparison between DQN and D3QN highlights the advancements in reinforcement learning algorithms
that enhance performance and stability. D3QN's integration of Double DQN and Dueling DQN principles
provides it with a significant edge in complex environments, making it a more suitable choice for applications
requiring high stability and efficiency. Future research could explore further enhancements to these
algorithms, potentially incorporating new techniques to improve learning speed and adaptability in even
more challenging scenarios.This exploration emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate Q-network
structures to maximize the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms in HVAC applications,
ultimately enhancing energy efficiency and system reliability.
